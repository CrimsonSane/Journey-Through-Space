TODO
These are ordered from highest priority to lowest priority.

1. Redo the mechanic of shooting strap, it should have hit points instead of being invinsible.
2. Clean up code again.
3. Mouse to button intergration.
4. Instructions on movement and how to play for user.
5. UI improvement.
6. New features to guns that don't have upgrades.
7. New sounds? Maybe?
9. Reimplement game objects to C for faster run time on slower machines. (It should run 60 FPS on my Windows VM with no problem.)
