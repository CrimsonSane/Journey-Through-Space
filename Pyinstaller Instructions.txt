This would depend on where pyinstaller is installed on your computer in order to
run the command on a command prompt.

Make sure all dependencies are installed before running otherwise it won't work.
Check requirements.txt for all the game's dependencies and of course you would need to install pyinstaller as well.

Here is a list of those locations according to the pyinstaller docs:

- Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXY\Scripts where XY stands for the major and minor Python version number, 
for example C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python34\Scripts for Python 3.4)
- GNU/Linux: /usr/bin/ or /home/[username]/.local/bin
- OS X (using the default Apple-supplied Python) /usr/bin
- OS X (using Python installed by homebrew) /usr/local/bin
- OS X (using Python installed by macports) /opt/local/bin


In a command prompt or terminal type: [the location to pyinstaller] "Journey Through Space.spec"

The executable should be installed on the dist folder.

By default all installs create a folder containing other files with the executable. Thought it isn't recommended but 
if you want only one executable file, type --onefile as the argument for pyinstaller and make sure to copy the 
Assets folder and Settings.txt in the same place as the executable. 

if you want a more custom install you refer to pyinstaller's documentation.
